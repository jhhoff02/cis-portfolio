        <p> Ten years ago, you would have performed each of those tasks in a completely different way (or you couldn’t perform them at all). Software seriously is eating the world really quickly. This is great news for developers. Developers are the people who are capable of building stuff for a world that is becoming increasingly more reliant on technology. That’s why the demand for developers is only going to increase more and more over the next ten years. The data backs this up. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, software developer jobs are expected to grow 17% from 2014 till 2024. They categorize this growth as “much faster” than the average rate among other professions.</p>
        <p> It’s not just Facebook, Google, and Uber that need developers. Almost every single industry is becoming dependent on people who know how to write code:</p>
        <ol type="I">
            <li><b>Business technology companies,</b> like 37 Signals, Mailchimp, and Salesforce are willing to pay a lot of money for developers who can solve their core business problems.</li>
            <li><b>Ad tech companies </b> rely on developers to build their platforms.</li>
            <li><b>Payments companies </b>, like Apple, PayPal, Square, and LevelUp need developers to help them gain ground in the payments space.</li>
            <li><b>Media companies</b>, like Huffington Post and Upworthy, need developers to build the custom tech stacks that allow them to publish large amounts of content at scale.</li>
            <li><b>Academia -</b>schools like Harvard hire developers to build libraries of digital knowledge.</li>
            <li><b>Embedded device companies</b>, like Fitbit and Apple, need developers to write the software for all of their connected devices.</li>
            <li><b>Automotive companies</b>, like Ford, have a ton of software developer positions posted on their site, especially with the race toward autonomous cars.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> This is by no means an exhaustive list. Insurance companies, mortgage brokers, government regulation industries, the military, and many more are actively seeking out developers and will continue to do so moving forward. The world’s growing reliance on technology to get things done is making developers more important than ever. And because technology is only going to change more and more over the next ten years, there has never been a better time to be a developer.</p>
